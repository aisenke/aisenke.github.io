		<h3><a name="product_design"></a>Product Design</h3>

		<p>We believe that product design is a challenging task.&nbsp;Manufacturers always concern about production cost while consumers look at the price, appearance and prestige value. At Aisenke, our experiences enable us to cover a full production lifecycle from project definition, initial design and development, hardware and software prototyping, to mass-production. We also take&nbsp;into account all aspects necessary&nbsp;before and after sales, because&nbsp;product usability and functionality are important. This includes how well the final product can be maintained, how easy to disassemble and reassemble again, how to perform firmware update&nbsp;by customer while&nbsp;system integrity is not being compromised. <a href="/Contact">Tell</a> us what you need, we can help to realize your brilliant ideas into new products.</p>

		<h3><a name="pcb_prototyping_and_assembly"></a>PCB Prototyping and Assembly</h3>

		<p>If you are looking for rapid and reliable turnkey PCB prototype and manufacturing services, you can count on Aisenke for it. Our complete services cover everything from electronic engineering design of the circuits, PCB layout engineering, PCB fabrication of bare boards, parts procurement and PCB assembly of a finished prototype.</p>

		<p>Each application can demand the use of a particular material in order to facilitate the best design. Aisenke has provided PCB&nbsp;using FR4 material, various Rogers materials,&nbsp;rigid-flex&nbsp;and flex boards. Every PCB design we&nbsp;provide&nbsp;is a custom one, unique to particular&nbsp;customers and carefully prepared from the ground up. We classify PCB prototyping in three&nbsp;groups: standard, advanced and critical; with&nbsp;its&nbsp;detail specification below:</p>

		<p>It is recommended that you submit your gerber files earlier for inspection, suggestion and price estimation in case your layout fall&nbsp;into the&nbsp;critical design category above. You need to let us know your&nbsp;preferences such as material brandname, type and quality when such particular information exist. We will try&nbsp;to provide all of your requirement at our best.</p>
